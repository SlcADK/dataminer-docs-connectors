## DataMiner Connectivity Framework

From version **1.0.2.1** of the connector onwards, DCF is supported, requiring a DMA with **8.5.4** as the minimum version.

### Interfaces

The dynamic interfaces are created based on the number of rows in the **tables 2800 Interfaces and 7400 VLANs (DCF Interfaces).**

- **Interfaces\_***instance value*\_*Interface Type*: Dynamic interface with type **inout**.
- **VLANs\_***instance value*\_*Interface Type*: Dynamic interface with type **inout.**
